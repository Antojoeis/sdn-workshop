Ideas for this workshop have come from a variety of sources including:

- Open Networking Foundation
- Scott Shenker's EE122 course notes
- Raj Jain's excellent Openflow, SDN & NFVs tutorial
- Ryubook documentation and Ryu getting started tutorials

The exercises include material developed by Dean Pemberton and Bryan Ng.

We are grateful to the efforts of the Ryu developers as well as the developers of Faucet and Gauge.
