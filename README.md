# Software Defined Networking Workshop

We are running a workshop at this year's eResearch conference in Queenstown. It is meant to be a taster for people who have not heard of Software Defined networking. The first part are some talks on "What is SDN" and "Why you might use it". The second part is a handson session where students get to play with the ryu controller and (time permitting) the [Faucet open source SDN switch](https://github.com/REANNZ/faucet).

## Logistics

The workshop is being held on Wednesday 10th February in Queenstown at [eResearch 2016](http://eresearch2016.org.nz/). 

Part 1 which is mostly an introduction to SDN and doesn't require any particular technical knowledge is from 11:15-13:00 in the Wakitipu Room.

Part 2 is after lunch in the same room and is your chance to bring along your laptop and we have the room from 14:00-17:30. All you need is a laptop with **ssh** installed, you will be running your code on a virtual machine hosted by us.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Basic networking knowledge (use of ping, network addressing) and having some basic familiarity with python would be useful but not essential.

## Power

We will be bringing extra powerboards but might be wise to fully charge your laptop the night before!
