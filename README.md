# Software Defined Networking Workshop

This workshop is a handson session where students get to play with mininet, ryu controller with a simple application and the [Faucet open source SDN switch](https://github.com/REANNZ/faucet).

This is a self-paced session.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Basic networking knowledge (use of ping, network addressing) and having some basic familiarity with python would be useful but not essential.
